# Introduction

Virtualization is a technology that runs on a software known as hypervisor, that allows access and creation of useful IT services using resources that are traditionaly bound to a hardware.
It allows  an organisation to run several virtual computers, opertating sysytems and applications on a single server and partitioning it into several virtual servers.

## Types of virtualization

1. Server virtualisation
2. Hardware virtualization
3. Software virtualisation
5. Application virtualization
6. Storage virtualization
7. Network virtualisation
8. Memory virtualisation
9. Desktop virtualization
10. Data virtualisation
11. Operating system virtualiation

## Benefits of virtualization

 1. Reduces IT expences
 2. Reduces workload
 3. Promotes digital enterpeneurship
 4. Faster deployment of recources
 5. Increase efficiency and producivity

## Virtualization platforms

1. VMware
2. Citrix
3. Microsoft
4. Oracle
5. Amazon

### Containerization vs Virtualization
A container is a lightweigh software that virtually packages  and isolates  multiple applications for deployment from one virtual machine or server while virtualization allows you to run several operating systems on the hardware of a single server.
