### Question 2

Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

### Question 7
Level 2

Question:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.
Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]] 

Hints:
Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.

### Question 10

Level 2

Question:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.

Level 2

### Question 12

Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


### Question 17
Level 2

Question:
Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:
D 100
W 200

D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100
Then, the output should be:
500

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Level 1

### Question 24

Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.

Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()

And add document for your own function
Hints:
The built-in document method is __doc__

### Question 37

Define a function which can generate and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).

Hints:

Use ** operator to get power of a number.
Use range() for loops.
Use list.append() to add values into a list.

### Question 41

Define a function which can generate and print a tuple where the value are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). 

Hints:

Use ** operator to get power of a number.
Use range() for loops.
Use list.append() to add values into a list.
Use tuple() to get a tuple from a list.


### Question 42

With a given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line. 

Hints:

Use [n1:n2] notation to get a slice from a tuple.


### Question 45

Write a program which can filter even numbers in a list by using filter function. The list is: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Hints:

Use filter() to filter some elements in a list.
Use lambda to define anonymous functions.
